### Notes 
The `http.HandlerFunc` type is a built-in type in Go's `net/http` package. It's an adapter that allows the use of ordinary functions as HTTP handlers. 
If `f` is a function with the appropriate signature (`func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`), `http.HandlerFunc(f)` is a `Handler` that calls `f`.

In your `AuthorizeHandler` function, you're returning an anonymous function with the signature `func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`. When you call `AuthorizeHandler()`, it returns this anonymous function as an `http.HandlerFunc`.

Here's the key part: `http.HandlerFunc` itself satisfies the `http.Handler` interface because it has a `ServeHTTP` method. This method just calls the function `f`.
 So when you return an `http.HandlerFunc` from your `AuthorizeHandler` function, you're actually returning something that has a `ServeHTTP` method, even though you 
 don't see it in your code.

This is why you can use `AuthorizeHandler()` as an argument to `http.Handle`. Even though `AuthorizeHandler()` doesn't explicitly return something with a `ServeHTTP` method, it returns an `http.HandlerFunc`, which does have a `ServeHTTP` method.

This is a common pattern in Go. It allows you to create flexible APIs and use functions as interfaces. It might seem a bit confusing at first, but it's a powerful feature once you get the hang of it.
